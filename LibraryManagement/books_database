The more money and power he amasses, the safer he is from threats. Except when it comes to the feisty small-town librarian that keeps him up at night . . . Sloane Walton is a spitfire determined to carry on her father's quest for justice. She'll do that just as soon as she figures out exactly what the man she hates did to - or for - her family.

There's no way she's going to give him a third chance. He's just going to have to make one for himself.",
